For the business quoute: not for you or the girl: nothing you want from them

Todo: Double check free trial forces timeout session
Double check streaks are working - as long as you have something logged everyday that's your streaks
Update the copy - exposure compliance under resistance 
Make support work on the bottom, like an email.
Onboarding for the app - make the web app an app on your iphone, get the iphone
make the features intuitive instead so you don't need onboarding. 
Clean it up don’t make it more then it needs to be. 
Optimize the copy for the crowd that just wants to get the girls part out of their life, 
remove the camera logging it doesn't mattr

Nice to have:
cold approaching metrics
virality metrics
onboarding showing you stats


I think I'm going to drop this because it dosen't seem massive. How do you do something
important and massive.
